# Nations

We have decided to create a game where players control cities and battle it out between each other. Players will spawn in with a city with stats generated from some random, real, country’s info. They can then build and upgrade their city, and take over surrounding empty cities. There will be a limit to how many people can spawn on each map, and if there are more players than the set amount, a new map will be created and all subsequent players will be added to this map. When players encounter other players, they can interact with each other in a variety of ways, from invading and taking over another player’s cities, to making alliances and friends.	
We plan on making this game multiplayer, and using apis to generate a player’s starting stats. This will make it interesting because if you’re really lucky, you can get a good country’s stats, but if you’re unlucky, it’ll be much harder to start off.
