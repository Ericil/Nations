#DomiNations

Ever harbored dreams of world domination? Control cities and battle it out with others in Nations, a muti-player nation building game. Start off with a city with stats based on data from real, randomly chosen countries. Build up your city and expand by taking over neighboring cities. Interact with  players, forge alliances, wage war against other cities, and expand your lands. But don't stop there. Aim for the world.

##Current Implemented Features
1. Players can build and upgrade their city.
2. Make buildings that allow them to increase their resource production
3. Make friends and chat with them.
4. Attack other people and gain their resources.
